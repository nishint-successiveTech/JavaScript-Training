# ðŸ”¬ Atomic Design by Brad Frost

**Atomic Design** is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down user interfaces into five hierarchical stages:

1. **Atoms**: Basic elements like buttons, inputs, and labels.

2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together, e.g., a form field.
