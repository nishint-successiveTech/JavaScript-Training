**Atomic Design** is a methodology for creating design systems by breaking down user interfaces into five hierarchical stages:

1. **Atoms**: Basic elements like buttons, inputs, and labels.
2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms functioning together, e.g., a form field.
3. **Organisms**: Complex components made of molecules and atoms, e.g., a navigation bar.
4. **Templates**: Page structures with placeholder content.
5. **Pages**: Final layouts with real content, showcasing the design.
